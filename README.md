# Issue case expossde:
5-year-old Shinchan had just started learning mathematics. Meanwhile, one of his studious classmates, Kazama, had already written a basic calculator which supports only three operations on integers: multiplication , addition , and subtraction . Since he had just learned about these operations, he didn't know about operator precedence, and so, in his calculator, all operators had the same precedence and were left-associative.

As always, Shinchan started to irritate him with his silly questions. He gave Kazama a list of  integers and asked him to insert one of the above operators between each pair of consecutive integers such that the result obtained after feeding the resulting expression in Kazama's calculator is divisible by . At his core, Shinchan is actually a good guy, so he only gave lists of integers for which an answer exists.

Can you help Kazama create the required expression? If multiple solutions exist, print any one of them. ---
 
 # Solution:
 Solution here was used few list an dictionary in recursive mode to build the rigth arithmetic expression.
